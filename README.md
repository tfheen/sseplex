SSEplex
=======

Current status: Not yet even a toy project.

This is a project along the same lines as
[esper](https://github.com/mikeycgto/esper), a server sent event hub
written in Rust. A difference is that this one is using
[actix](https://actix.rs/) as the underlying framework.

So far there is no authentication, the messages are just generated
tick messages and it's not at all useful except possibly to look at
how I'm using actix.
